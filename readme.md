# Trois-Rivières

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. 🎉

## Project Structure

```
    .
    ├── dist
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── src
    │   ├── HelloWorldScene.js
    │   ├── main.js
	├── index.html
    ├── package.json
```

JavaScript files are intended for the `src` folder. `main.js` is the entry point referenced by `index.html`.

Other than that there is no opinion on how you should structure your project.

There is an example `HelloWorldScene.js` file that can be placed inside a `scenes` folder to organize by type or elsewhere to organize by function. For example, you can keep all files specific to the HelloWorld scene in a `hello-world` folder.

It is all up to you!

## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder.

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    ├── images
    │   ├── my-image.png
    ├── music
    │   ├── ...
    ├── sfx
    │   ├── ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

# ESLint

This template uses a basic `eslint` set up for code linting to help you find and fix common problems in your JavaScript code.

It does not aim to be opinionated.
